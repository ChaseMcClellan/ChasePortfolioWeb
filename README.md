ChasePortfolioWeb

A personal full-stack portfolio website built with .NET, showcasing software projects, profile details, and technical skills — designed to reflect professional capability, showcase growth, and serve as a live example of your engineering work.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

.NET (C#) — backend logic, data handling

MVC / Razor / Blazor — presentation and view rendering

HTML / CSS / JavaScript — front-end markup, styling, interactivity

Azure — deployment and data persistence
